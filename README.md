## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) and clone this repository.

```bash
$ npm install -g serverless
$ git clone https://github.com/will3g/GoChatAI.git
$ cd GoChatAI
```

## Configuration

You'll need to configure a few environment variables to run the chatbot. First, you'll need to create an OpenAI API key and set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Next, you'll need to create a Twilio account and set the AWS endpoint on Twilio whatsapp service, and you'll need to create a phone number that you'll be using for the chatbot.

## Deployment

To deploy the chatbot, simply run the following command:

```bash
$ serverless deploy
```

This will deploy the chatbot to AWS Lambda and create an endpoint for Twilio to send messages to.

## Usage

To use the chatbot, simply send a WhatsApp message to the phone number that you configured earlier. The chatbot will reply with a message generated by GPT-3.
